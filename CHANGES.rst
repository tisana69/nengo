   - One-line description of change (link to Github issue/PR)

.. Changes should be organized in one of several sections:

   - Added
   - Changed
   - Deprecated
   - Removed
   - Fixed

2.2.1 (unreleased)
==================

**Added**

- Added an optimizer to the reference builder that reduces simulation times for
  model with a large number of small ensembles.
  (`#1035 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1035>`_)


**Deprecated**

- Access to ``nengo.Simulator.model`` is deprecated. To access static data
  generated during the build use ``nengo.Simulator.data``. It provides access
  to everything that ``nengo.Simulator.model.params`` used to provide access to
  and is the canonical way to access this data across different backends.
  (`#1145 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1145>`_,
  `#1173 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1173>`_)


2.2.0 (September 12, 2016)
==========================

**API changes**

- It is now possible to pass a NumPy array to the ``function`` argument
  of ``nengo.Connection``. The values in the array are taken to be the
  targets in the decoder solving process, which means that the ``eval_points``
  must also be set on the connection.
  (`#1010 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1010>`_)
- ``nengo.utils.connection.target_function`` is now deprecated, and will
  be removed in Nengo 3.0. Instead, pass the targets directly to the
  connection through the ``function`` argument.
  (`#1010 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1010>`_)

**Behavioural changes**

- Dropped support for NumPy 1.6. Oldest supported NumPy version is now 1.7.
  (`#1147 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1147>`_)

**Improvements**

- Added a ``nengo.backends`` entry point to make the reference simulator
  discoverable for other Python packages. In the future all backends should
  declare an entry point accordingly.
  (`#1127 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1127>`_)
- Added ``ShapeParam`` to store array shapes.
  (`#1045 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1045>`_)
- Added ``ThresholdingPreset`` to configure ensembles for thresholding.
  (`#1058 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1058>`_,
  `#1077 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1077>`_,
  `#1148 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1148>`_)
- Tweaked ``rasterplot`` so that spikes from different neurons don't overlap.
  (`#1121 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1121>`_)

**Documentation**

- Added a page explaining the config system and preset configs.
  (`#1150 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1150>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed some situations where the cache index becomes corrupt by
  writing the updated cache index atomically (in most cases).
  (`#1097 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1097>`_,
  `#1107 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1107>`_)
- The synapse methods ``filt`` and ``filtfilt`` now support lists as input.
  (`#1123 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1123>`_)
- Added a registry system so that only stable objects are cached.
  (`#1054 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1054>`_,
  `#1068 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1068>`_)

2.1.2 (June 27, 2016)
=====================

**Bug fixes**

- The DecoderCache is now more robust when used improperly, and no longer
  requires changes to backends in order to use properly.
  (`#1112 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1112>`_)

2.1.1 (June 24, 2016)
=====================

**Improvements**

- Improved the default ``LIF`` neuron model to spike at the same rate as the
  ``LIFRate`` neuron model for constant inputs. The older model has been
  moved to `nengo_extras <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_extras>`_
  under the name ``FastLIF``.
  (`#975 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/975>`_)
- Added ``y0`` attribute to ``WhiteSignal``, which adjusts the phase of each
  dimension to begin with absolute value closest to ``y0``.
  (`#1064 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1064>`_)
- Allow the ``AssociativeMemory`` to accept Semantic Pointer expressions as
  ``input_keys`` and ``output_keys``.
  (`#982 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/982>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- The DecoderCache is used as context manager instead of relying on the
  ``__del__`` method for cleanup. This should solve problems with the
  cache's file lock not being removed. It might be necessary to
  manually remove the ``index.lock`` file in the cache directory after
  upgrading from an older Nengo version.
  (`#1053 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1053>`_,
  `#1041 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1041>`_,
  `#1048 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1048>`_)
- If the cache index is corrupted, we now fail gracefully by invalidating
  the cache and continuing rather than raising an exception.
  (`#1110 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1110>`_,
  `#1097 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1097>`_)
- The ``Nnls`` solver now works for weights. The ``NnlsL2`` solver is
  improved since we clip values to be non-negative before forming
  the Gram system.
  (`#1027 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1027>`_,
  `#1019 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1019>`_)
- Eliminate memory leak in the parameter system.
  (`#1089 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1089>`_,
  `#1090 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1090>`_)
- Allow recurrence of the form ``a=b, b=a`` in basal ganglia SPA actions.
  (`#1098 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1098>`_,
  `#1099 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1099>`_)
- Support a greater range of Jupyter notebook and ipywidgets versions with the
  the ``ipynb`` extensions.
  (`#1088 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/1088>`_,
  `#1085 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/1085>`_)

2.1.0 (April 27, 2016)
======================

**API changes**

- A new class for representing stateful functions called ``Process``
  has been added. ``Node`` objects are now process-aware, meaning that
  a process can be used as a node's ``output``. Unlike non-process
  callables, processes are properly reset when a simulator is reset.
  See the ``processes.ipynb`` example notebook, or the API documentation
  for more details.
  (`#590 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/590>`_,
  `#652 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652>`_,
  `#945 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945>`_,
  `#955 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/955>`_)
- Spiking ``LIF`` neuron models now accept an additional argument,
  ``min_voltage``. Voltages are clipped such that they do not drop below
  this value (previously, this was fixed at 0).
  (`#666 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/666>`_)
- The ``PES`` learning rule no longer accepts a connection as an argument.
  Instead, error information is transmitted by making a connection to the
  learning rule object (e.g.,
  ``nengo.Connection(error_ensemble, connection.learning_rule)``.
  (`#344 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/344>`_,
  `#642 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642>`_)
- The ``modulatory`` attribute has been removed from ``nengo.Connection``.
  This was only used for learning rules to this point, and has been removed
  in favor of connecting directly to the learning rule.
  (`#642 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642>`_)
- Connection weights can now be probed with ``nengo.Probe(conn, 'weights')``,
  and these are always the weights that will change with learning
  regardless of the type of connection. Previously, either ``decoders`` or
  ``transform`` may have changed depending on the type of connection;
  it is now no longer possible to probe ``decoders`` or ``transform``.
  (`#729 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/729>`_)
- A version of the AssociativeMemory SPA module is now available as a
  stand-alone network in ``nengo.networks``. The AssociativeMemory SPA module
  also has an updated argument list.
  (`#702 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/702>`_)
- The ``Product`` and ``InputGatedMemory`` networks no longer accept a
  ``config`` argument. (`#814 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/814>`_)
- The ``EnsembleArray`` network's ``neuron_nodes`` argument is deprecated.
  Instead, call the new ``add_neuron_input`` or ``add_neuron_output`` methods.
  (`#868 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/868>`_)
- The ``nengo.log`` utility function now takes a string ``level`` parameter
  to specify any logging level, instead of the old binary ``debug`` parameter.
  Cache messages are logged at DEBUG instead of INFO level.
  (`#883 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/883>`_)
- Reorganised the Associative Memory code, including removing many extra
  parameters from ``nengo.networks.assoc_mem.AssociativeMemory`` and modifying
  the defaults of others.
  (`#797 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/797>`_)
- Add ``close`` method to ``Simulator``. ``Simulator`` can now be used
  used as a context manager.
  (`#857 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/857>`_,
  `#739 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/739>`_,
  `#859 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/859>`_)
- Most exceptions that Nengo can raise are now custom exception classes
  that can be found in the ``nengo.exceptions`` module.
  (`#781 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/781>`_)
- All Nengo objects (``Connection``, ``Ensemble``, ``Node``, and ``Probe``)
  now accept a ``label`` and ``seed`` argument if they didn't previously.
  (`#958 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/859>`_)
- In ``nengo.synapses``, ``filt`` and ``filtfilt`` are deprecated. Every
  synapse type now has ``filt`` and ``filtfilt`` methods that filter
  using the synapse.
  (`#945 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945>`_)
- ``Connection`` objects can now accept a ``Distribution`` for the transform
  argument; the transform matrix will be sampled from that distribution
  when the model is built.
  (`#979 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/979>`_).

**Behavioural changes**

- The sign on the ``PES`` learning rule's error has been flipped to conform
  with most learning rules, in which error is minimized. The error should be
  ``actual - target``. (`#642 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642>`_)
- The ``PES`` rule's learning rate is invariant to the number of neurons
  in the presynaptic population. The effective speed of learning should now
  be unaffected by changes in the size of the presynaptic population.
  Existing learning networks may need to be updated; to achieve identical
  behavior, scale the learning rate by ``pre.n_neurons / 100``.
  (`#643 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/643>`_)
- The ``probeable`` attribute of all Nengo objects is now implemented
  as a property, rather than a configurable parameter.
  (`#671 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671>`_)
- Node functions receive ``x`` as a copied NumPy array (instead of a readonly
  view).
  (`#716 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/716>`_,
  `#722 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/722>`_)
- The SPA Compare module produces a scalar output (instead of a specific
  vector).
  (`#775 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/775>`_,
  `#782 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/782>`_)
- Bias nodes in ``spa.Cortical``, and gate ensembles and connections in
  ``spa.Thalamus`` are now stored in the target modules.
  (`#894 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/894>`_,
  `#906 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/906>`_)
- The ``filt`` and ``filtfilt`` functions on ``Synapse`` now use the initial
  value of the input signal to initialize the filter output by default. This
  provides more accurate filtering at the beginning of the signal, for signals
  that do not start at zero.
  (`#945 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945>`_)

**Improvements**

- Added ``Ensemble.noise`` attribute, which injects noise directly into
  neurons according to a stochastic ``Process``.
  (`#590 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/590>`_)
- Added a ``randomized_svd`` subsolver for the L2 solvers. This can be much
  quicker for large numbers of neurons or evaluation points.
  (`#803 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/803>`_)
- Added ``PES.pre_tau`` attribute, which sets the time constant on a lowpass
  filter of the presynaptic activity.
  (`#643 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/643>`_)
- ``EnsembleArray.add_output`` now accepts a list of functions
  to be computed by each ensemble.
  (`#562 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/562>`_,
  `#580 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/580>`_)
- ``LinearFilter`` now has an ``analog`` argument which can be set
  through its constructor. Linear filters with digital coefficients
  can be specified by setting ``analog`` to ``False``.
  (`#819 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/819>`_)
- Added ``SqrtBeta`` distribution, which describes the distribution
  of semantic pointer elements.
  (`#414 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/414>`_,
  `#430 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/430>`_)
- Added ``Triangle`` synapse, which filters with a triangular FIR filter.
  (`#660 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/660>`_)
- Added ``utils.connection.eval_point_decoding`` function, which
  provides a connection's static decoding of a list of evaluation points.
  (`#700 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/700>`_)
- Resetting the Simulator now resets all Processes, meaning the
  injected random signals and noise are identical between runs,
  unless the seed is changed (which can be done through
  ``Simulator.reset``).
  (`#582 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/582>`_,
  `#616 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/616>`_,
  `#652 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652>`_)
- An exception is raised if SPA modules are not properly assigned to an SPA
  attribute.
  (`#730 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/730>`_,
  `#791 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/791>`_)
- The ``Product`` network is now more accurate.
  (`#651 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/651>`_)
- Numpy arrays can now be used as indices for slicing objects.
  (`#754 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/754>`_)
- ``Config.configures`` now accepts multiple classes rather than
  just one. (`#842 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/842>`_)
- Added ``add`` method to ``spa.Actions``, which allows
  actions to be added after module has been initialized.
  (`#861 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/861>`_,
  `#862 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/862>`_)
- Added SPA wrapper for circular convolution networks, ``spa.Bind``
  (`#849 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/849>`_)
- Added the ``Voja`` (Vector Oja) learning rule type, which updates an
  ensemble's encoders to fire selectively for its inputs. (see
  ``examples/learning/learn_associations.ipynb``).
  (`#727 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/727>`_)
- Added a clipped exponential distribution useful for thresholding, in
  particular in the AssociativeMemory.
  (`#779 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/779>`_)
- Added a cosine similarity distribution, which is the distribution of the
  cosine of the angle between two random vectors. It is useful for setting
  intercepts, in particular when using the ``Voja`` learning rule.
  (`#768 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/768>`_)
- ``nengo.synapses.LinearFilter`` now has an ``evaluate`` method to
  evaluate the filter response to sine waves of given frequencies. This can
  be used to create Bode plots, for example.
  (`#945 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/945>`_)
- ``nengo.spa.Vocabulary`` objects now have a ``readonly`` attribute that
  can be used to disallow adding new semantic pointers. Vocabulary subsets
  are read-only by default.
  (`#699 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/699>`_)
- Improved performance of the decoder cache by writing all decoders
  of a network into a single file.
  (`#946 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/946>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed issue where setting ``Connection.seed`` through the constructor had
  no effect. (`#724 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/725>`_)
- Fixed issue in which learning connections could not be sliced.
  (`#632 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/632>`_)
- Fixed issue when probing scalar transforms.
  (`#667 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/667>`_,
  `#671 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671>`_)
- Fix for SPA actions that route to a module with multiple inputs.
  (`#714 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/714>`_)
- Corrected the ``rmses`` values in ``BuiltConnection.solver_info`` when using
  ``NNls`` and ``Nnl2sL2`` solvers, and the ``reg`` argument for ``Nnl2sL2``.
  (`#839 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/839>`_)
- ``spa.Vocabulary.create_pointer`` now respects the specified number of
  creation attempts, and returns the most dissimilar pointer if none can be
  found below the similarity threshold.
  (`#817 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/817>`_)
- Probing a Connection's output now returns the output of that individual
  Connection, rather than the input to the Connection's post Ensemble.
  (`#973 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/973>`_,
  `#974 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/974>`_)
- Fixed thread-safety of using networks and config in ``with`` statements.
  (`#989 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/989>`_)
- The decoder cache will only be used when a seed is specified.
  (`#946 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/946>`_)

2.0.4 (April 27, 2016)
======================

**Bug fixes**

- Cache now fails gracefully if the ``legacy.txt`` file cannot be read.
  This can occur if a later version of Nengo is used.

2.0.3 (December 7, 2015)
========================

**API changes**

- The ``spa.State`` object replaces the old ``spa.Memory`` and ``spa.Buffer``.
  These old modules are deprecated and will be removed in 2.2.
  (`#796 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/796>`_)

2.0.2 (October 13, 2015)
========================

2.0.2 is a bug fix release to ensure that Nengo continues
to work with more recent versions of Jupyter
(formerly known as the IPython notebook).

**Behavioural changes**

- The IPython notebook progress bar has to be activated with
  ``%load_ext nengo.ipynb``.
  (`#693 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/693>`_)

**Improvements**

- Added ``[progress]`` section to ``nengorc`` which allows setting
  ``progress_bar`` and ``updater``.
  (`#693 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/693>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix compatibility issues with newer versions of IPython,
  and Jupyter. (`#693 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/693>`_)

2.0.1 (January 27, 2015)
========================

**Behavioural changes**

- Node functions receive ``t`` as a float (instead of a NumPy scalar)
  and ``x`` as a readonly NumPy array (instead of a writeable array).
  (`#626 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/626>`_,
  `#628 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/628>`_)

**Improvements**

- ``rasterplot`` works with 0 neurons, and generates much smaller PDFs.
  (`#601 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/601>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix compatibility with NumPy 1.6.
  (`#627 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/627>`_)

2.0.0 (January 15, 2015)
========================

Initial release of Nengo 2.0!
Supports Python 2.6+ and 3.3+.
Thanks to all of the contributors for making this possible!
